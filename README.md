This is a responsive website that utilizes React.  It receives a search term and utilizes a Google Book API to search for titles of books. The user may then save one of the books. After saving the book, the user automatically gets redirected to the Saved tab, which is cool because we didn't learn this in class, how to do it, that is.  The books get saved on a second page.  the user may click on an anchor on the navigation bar to see saved books.

# How to test this app

Type in a word and see if results get returned that have to do with what you typed.  Also, save a book. Click on the save button, then you should automatically be taken to the Saved tab.  Delete a book. Check if it disappears.  Click on each page to make sure you can get there.
